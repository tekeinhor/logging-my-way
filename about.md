Here you can find various behind-the-scenes details about this website:

## Inspiration

Many layout ideas on the home page were inspired by the website of my pal [Sage](https://www.wavebeem.com/).
They also drew my profile picture :)

## Hosting

This website is currently hosted by [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

No third party embeds. This is even enforced with `Content-Security-Policy`.
And yes, this means there are no analytics whatsoever.

## Content management

This website is generated with [Lume](https://lume.land/), a static site generator that runs on [Deno](https://deno.land/).


## Typefaces

This website is set in [Recursive by Arrow Type](https://www.recursive.design/)â€¦
yes, including code snippets: this is a variable font that has "monospace-ness" as a variability axis.

Also, [Silkscreen](https://kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/) is used for the tiny nostalgic badges at the bottom of the page.

## Icons

Brand icons are from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/)
while others like "email" are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
